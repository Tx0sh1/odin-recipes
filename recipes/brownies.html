    <h4>Frosting:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons milk</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Decorations:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>24 candy eyeballs</li>
        <li>12 red candy-coated chocolate pieces (such as M&M's®)</li>
        <li>60 candy corn, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
        Spray a 12-cup mini muffin tin with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Make the brownies: Cream butter and sugar together
             in a bowl with an electric mixer. Add egg and vanilla; 
             mix well. Stir flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and 
             salt together in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to 
             butter mixture and mix until batter is smooth. Divide batter 
             evenly among the prepared muffin cups.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the 
            center comes out clean, about 14 minutes. Cool in the tin for 
            5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the frosting: Combine butter, cocoa powder, and milk 
            in a bowl and mix with an electric mixer until smooth. Gradually add powdered 
            sugar and mix until frosting is smooth and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Spoon frosting in a piping bag fitted with a Wilton #10 tip. Pipe a circle of 
            frosting near the bottom half of each mini brownie to create the turkey's head. 
            Add two candy eyes. Add 1 red chocolate piece to form the beak. Pipe 5 lines of 
            frosting in the shape of a semi-circle formation coming up from the head. Place 
            a piece of candy corn on each of the 5 lines to form the turkey's feathers.</li>
    </ol>
