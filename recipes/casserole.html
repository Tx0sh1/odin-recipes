    <img src="casserole.jpg" alt="casserole">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Give classic green bean casserole a new spin by booting the canned mushroom soup. 
        Expect fresh green beans cooked to tender-crisp perfection in a delicious, homemade sauce, 
        topped with crunchy onions and served as mini casseroles.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 medium shallot, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>½ cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 strip crispy cooked bacon, crumbled</li>
        <li>½ cup French-fried onions (such as French's®)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steaps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly-salted water to a rolling boil. Add beans and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes. (The beans will not soften too much more during baking, so if you want them softer, cook to your preference.)</li>
        <li>Drain beans, run under cold water, and place in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. When beans are chilled, drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray the inside of 4 ramekins with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and shallot and cook until they start to brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle flour over the mushrooms, stirring well to combine. Gradually pour in chicken stock, soy sauce, Dijon, and thyme, stirring constantly; the mixture will be thick at this point. Stir in half-and-half, salt, and pepper until well combined. Reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors have melded and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in green beans and bacon until well combined. Spoon into the prepared ramekins and top with French-fried onions.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 13 to 15 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
